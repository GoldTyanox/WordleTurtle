A project made for Computer Science Class.
A fully functional (hopefully no bugs) Wordle game made completely with the Python Turtle module(and technically also random, subprocess, and pyspellchecker).
The time module is imported but it's technically never used.
Please install the font if you want to full experience.
Created in about 2 weeks.
